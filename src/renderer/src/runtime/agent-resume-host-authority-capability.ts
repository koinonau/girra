// Why: every agent added to RESUMABLE_TUI_AGENTS after agent-session.host-authority.v1 widens the
// host's ensureAgentSession enum. An older host answers the unknown member with invalid_argument,
// which runRemoteAgentSessionLaunch does not treat as a fallback signal, so the pane dies instead
// of degrading to a legacy launch. Probing the agent's own capability keeps version skew safe.
// The exhaustive Record makes the next RESUMABLE_TUI_AGENTS entry a compile error until its own
// gate, or a deliberate `undefined`, is declared here.
