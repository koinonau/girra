/**
 * Why: settings that describe the LOCAL host — `terminalWindowsShell`, which decides how a queued
 * command is quoted — must not be applied to a row whose files live on an SSH target, because that
 * machine runs its own shell. The CLI name itself no longer varies: `girra` replaced the Linux-only
 * `orca-ide` rename, so every host launches the same command.
 *
 * The question is "does an SSH target hold this row's files", not "what may this client dial", so
 * it resolves the execution host instead of reading the raw `connectionId` field. SSH ownership has
 * two spellings and the raw read is wrong in both directions:
 *
 *   - a row carrying only `executionHostId: 'ssh:<target>'` reads as local and takes local-host
 *     settings the remote cannot honour;
 *   - a row that declares itself `local` while a stale `connectionId` survives reads as remote and
 *     loses the local-host settings it needs.
 *
 * `runtime:<env>` keeps its nested SSH target (that machine reaches the files through its own relay
 * shim), while a runtime host with no nested target is a full Girra install and stays false — as do
 * WSL and local. Callers routing a client-local PTY want `getSshTargetIdForExecutionHost` instead;
 * callers that already hold a resolved launch connection should read that, not re-derive here.
