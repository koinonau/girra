# Girra Instructions

Girra is a personal fork of Orca with 103 features deleted and the Orca identity stripped. Read `handover.md` first; it holds every fact this file relies on.

## Start Here

Measured 2026-09-14. No tracker exists, so these come from the build plan's phases. Phases 0 to 2, the ADRs and the harness deletion are done.

1. **Phase 3, instrumented strips.** orca-profiles, crash-reporting, then telemetry, deleting telemetry call sites outright. Profiles reach 141 files; local profiles are dropped too, so collapse to the default profile. The kept "Orca profile sign-out confirmation" signs out of a cloud account, so it goes with sign-in. Unblocked once Phase 2 is merged.
2. **Web renderer and pairing.** Resolve the feature-tree conflict recorded in `handover.md`. Needs the user.
3. **Workflows.** Choose which of the 36 remaining workflows survive before GitHub Actions is re-enabled. Needs the user.
4. **Phase 4, minor agent CLIs.** Unblocked once Phase 3 is merged.

## Backlog

[GIRRA-BUILD-PLAN.md](GIRRA-BUILD-PLAN.md) is the backlog. Each phase is one story, taken in order. Phases 2 and 3 name their modules in ascending coupling; keep that order.

When a tracker exists, record its project, ready status, and transition IDs here.

## Loop

1. Read the phase in the build plan and every file it names.
2. Find every caller of anything you will delete: `grep -rl` over `src`, excluding `.test.` files.
3. Delete, then fix the callers.
4. While fixing, run `pnpm tc`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build` when a deleted module was a build entry, and only the tests that touch what changed: the callers found in step 2, plus `config/scripts` when workflows or lint config change. The full suite takes 13 to 22 minutes, so run it once, when the phase is otherwise done. Run everything through `mise exec --`, with `ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1` for tests, as `handover.md` lists. Read the pass and fail counts from the output, not the exit code of a pipeline. Rerun any newly failing test file alone before calling it a regression.
5. Run the full `pnpm tc`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`, and compare against the baseline in `handover.md`. A phase is done when typecheck, lint and build pass and only the baseline's known tests fail. Deleting a feature may remove known failures; record the new baseline when it does.
6. Update `handover.md` and this file's "Start Here" in the same commit.

## Commits

One pull request per story. Cut the branch from `origin/main`, stage files by name, push, and open the pull request against `main` on `koinonau/girra`.

When a story must build on an unmerged one, stack it: branch from the earlier story's branch and target that branch. After the earlier pull request merges, retarget the stacked one to `main` with `gh pr edit --base main` before deleting the merged branch. Deleting it first closes the stacked pull request.

Actions is disabled, so no CI runs. The local checks in the loop stand in for CI until workflows are pruned and Actions is re-enabled.

Standing permission from the user, 2026-09-14: work through the phases without waiting for approval, and merge each pull request and clean up its branch once step 5 passes. Merge with a merge commit so `git branch -d` recognises the branch, then run the cleanup from the global instructions.

## Orca's Agent Instructions

`CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`, Orca's own contributor guide, and both load in every session here. Follow its code conventions: design system, style, max-lines, cross-platform, SSH and git compatibility. Where it and this file differ on process, this file wins. Its sections on the mobile companion and cloud features describe code girra is deleting.

## Decisions

Raise a decision with the question, each option with its cost and what it buys, a recommendation with its reason, and what happens once answered. Measure before recommending wherever a number exists. The open decisions live in `handover.md`.

## Not Alone

Ask the user first:

- Re-enabling GitHub Actions on `koinonau/girra`.
- Pushing to `main` directly, or force-pushing any branch. Merging a pull request through GitHub is permitted; see "Commits".
- Pushing tags, or anything against `stablyai/orca`. Its push URL is `DISABLED`; keep it so. Orca's tags point into unsquashed history.
- Cherry-picking upstream commits into `main`. A merge from upstream fails; `main` shares no ancestry with it.
- Deleting the local `orca-full-history` branch. It is the only copy of Orca's full history in this clone.
- Choosing any open decision in `handover.md`.
- Ticking or unticking features in `GIRRA-FEATURE-TREE.md`.
- Installing a global Node version, or running any build step with `sudo`. `mise.toml` pins Node for this repository.

## Skills

- `writing-clearly-and-concisely` before writing any file, commit message or pull request.
- `verification-before-completion` before calling a phase done.
- `architecture-decisions` before carrying a hard-to-reverse, surprising trade-off into code. Records live in `docs/adr/`.
- `autonomous` for handover upkeep and commits.
